        <p>Did you know FedEx and UPS shipments come with a money-back guarantee if delivered late by 60 seconds or more? Yet, an estimated $2 billion goes unclaimed annually due to the lengthy, overly-complicated process of claiming refunds. 71lbs proactively monitors your shipping accounts, identifies late deliveries, and files the claims on your behalf.</p>
        <p>Refunds are credited directly to your account with the shipping carrier, and our fee is 50% of the collected refunds. No start-up cost. No monthly fee. No contract.</p>
        <p>Customers receive an easy-to-use dashboard on our website to view reports detailing your shipments, refunds, and more - all to assist with shipping expense management. With an estimated 5% of shipped packages arriving late, monitoring the activity on your account with your carrier is important to your practiceâ€™s bottom line. </p>
